# Spotify-Track-Data-Pipeline-Integration-Storage-and-Visualization
Developed a Python-based application to extract, process, and visualize Spotify track metadata. Integrated Spotify's API with a MySQL database to store track details, ensuring data persistence and efficient querying.


This project demonstrates end-to-end integration with Spotify's API to fetch and process track metadata, store it in a MySQL database, and create visualizations for track-specific details. The pipeline involves:

Fetching track information using Spotify's API with Spotipy.
Storing track details like name, artist, album, popularity, and duration in a MySQL database with an upsert mechanism to handle duplicates.
Using Pandas to transform data into CSV format for further analysis.
Visualizing track features such as popularity and duration using Matplotlib.
This project showcases skills in API integration, database management, data processing, and visualization, making it a great example of real-world data handling and analysis.
